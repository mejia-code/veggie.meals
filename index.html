        "What is Ayurveda? Ayurveda, a natural system of medicine, originated in
        India more than 3,000 years ago. The term Ayurveda is derived from the
        Sanskrit words ayur (life) and veda (science or knowledge). Thus,
        Ayurveda translates to knowledge of life. Based on the idea that disease
        is due to an imbalance or stress in a person's consciousness, Ayurveda
        encourages certain lifestyle interventions and natural therapies to
        regain a balance between the body, mind, spirit, and the environment."
